Setting up an Android build environment on Ubuntu

1) Unless it's a completely fresh Ubuntu installation, many people might have the wrong version of Java installed. Let's fix that first.

The command below makes sure you're starting with a clean slate. Copy and paste it into a terminal (command prompt) window:

Code:
sudo apt-get remove openjdk-* icedtea-* icedtea6-*

If necessary, follow the on-screen instructions to remove any stray Java versions. Otherwise, move on to the next step.

2) Install the main build tools with this command:

Code:
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk git ccache automake lzop bison gperf build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev zlib1g-dev:i386 g++-multilib python-networkx libxml2-utils bzip2 libbz2-dev libbz2-1.0 libghc-bzlib-dev squashfs-tools pngcrush schedtool dpkg-dev liblz4-tool make optipng maven


3) Now to install Java:

Code:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa

Then, install OpenJDK 8:

Code:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk


That's it on the package side of things.

4) "repo" communicates with git servers for all that precious source code. The next command will grab it:

Code:
mkdir ~/bin && curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo && chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

5) Use your favorite text editor to open ~/.bashrc - I like nano:

Code:
nano ~/.bashrc

6) At the very bottom (use the Page Down key) paste this code to a new line:

Code:
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
export USE_CCACHE=1

7) Save it. In nano that would be Ctrl-O and then Enter. Then Ctrl-X to exit back to a prompt. Restart bash:

Code:
source ~/.bashrc

8) In the terminal, navigate to where you would like to download the LineageOS source code. The commands below will make it in your home folder, but if you have limited space you may want to create it somewhere else. Faster is better, i.e. SSD would be best, USB external (even 3.0) will be comparatively slow. Here we go:

Code:
mkdir ~/lineage
cd ~/lineage

9) Now you're going to initialize the repo.

Code:
repo init -u https://github.com/lineageos/android -b cm-14.1

10) Last step. Time to get the source, many gigabytes of downloading await.

Don't worry, it's automated. It's the last one!

Code:
repo sync


That's it! Everything should be ready to go!
